        How to Calculate Your Air Conditioner’s Annual Electricity Bill in India
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Air conditioners are essential for beating the heat in India, but they
        can contribute significantly to your electricity bill. With energy
        prices rising, understanding your AC's annual electricity consumption is
        key to managing costs effectively. In this guide, we’ll walk you through
        how to calculate your AC’s power usage using a simple formula, explain
        the factors that affect energy consumption, and introduce our AC Bill
        Calculator to make the process easier.

          The Formula to Calculate Annual AC Power Consumption
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Annual Energy Consumption (kWh) = 8 hours/day × 30 days × 8 months
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Power Rating (kW):</strong> This information is found on the
          AC’s energy efficiency sticker, usually near the star rating label.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>8 Hours Daily:</strong> Assumes an average daily usage of 8
          hours.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>30 Days per Month:</strong> Accounts for consistent usage
          during the cooling season.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>8 Months:</strong> Represents the typical duration of AC use
          in a year for most regions in India.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Adjusting for temperature settings: The formula assumes you keep your
          AC set at 24°C, which is the recommended temperature for balancing
          comfort and energy efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          For every degree above 24°C, you save about 6% on energy consumption.
          For example, if you set your AC at 26°C instead of 24°C, you could
          reduce annual energy consumption by 12%.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Example Calculation</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Let’s consider a 1.5-ton Lloyd AC, used for 8 hours daily at 24°C for
          8 months (This is called Annual Consumption). The annual energy
          consumption mentioned on the AC’s sticker is 956.79 units (kWh).
          Here’s how the calculation works:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            Calculate Annual Usage in Hours:
            <p>8 hours/day × 30 days/month × 8 months = 1,920 hours annually</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Determine Per-Hour Energy Consumption:
            <p>
              Using the annual consumption data from the sticker: 956.79 units ÷
              1,920 hours = 0.4983 units per hour
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Calculate Monthly Cost for 6 Hours Daily Usage:
            <p>
              6 hours/day × 30 days × 0.4983 units/hour = 89.694 units per month
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If the electricity tariff is ₹6 per unit, the monthly cost is:
          <p>89.694 units × ₹6/unit = ₹538.16</p>
        </p>
        <p>
          Adjust for Higher Temperature Settings: If you set your AC at 25°C
          instead of 24°C, your energy consumption reduces by 6%. Thus:
        </p>
        <p>₹538.16 × 0.94 = ₹505.87</p>
        <p>
          By simply increasing the temperature by 1°C, you save approximately
          ₹32 in a month. This calculation assumes usage at 24°C. Adjustments
          for higher temperature settings are factored in for better energy
          efficiency.

          Factors Affecting AC Electricity Consumption
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            AC Type: The type of AC—split, window, or portable—plays a
            significant role in energy usage. Split ACs are generally more
            efficient, while older window ACs tend to consume more power.
          </li>
          <li>
            Star Rating: Higher star ratings mean better energy efficiency. For
            instance:
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>A 5-star AC consumes 20–30% less energy than a 3-star AC.</li>
              <li>
                Check the star label for the annual power consumption in kWh.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Room Size and Insulation: Using an AC with the correct capacity for
            your room size ensures optimal performance.
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>A 1-ton AC is ideal for rooms up to 120 sq. ft.</li>
              <li>A 1.5-ton AC is better for larger rooms.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Temperature Settings: Keeping your AC at 24°C ensures efficient
            operation. Lower settings, like 18°C, can increase energy
            consumption by up to 30%.
          </li>
          <li>
            Usage Hours: More hours of usage directly increase electricity
            consumption. Optimizing usage during peak heat hours can reduce
            costs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintenance: Regular cleaning of filters and timely servicing
            improves energy efficiency, reducing power consumption.
          </li>
        </ul>
