          How AC Star Ratings Impact Your Monthly Electricity Costs
        </h1>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Air conditioners have become a must-have in today’s homes, especially
          during hot summers. But as cooling comforts us, the rising electricity
          bills might not. If you’ve ever wondered how AC star ratings impact
          your monthly electricity cost, you’re in the right place. In this
          blog, we’ll break it down simply, compare 3-star and 5-star ACs, and
          explain how you can estimate energy consumption with our AC Energy
          Savings Calculator.

          What Are AC Star Ratings?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          AC star ratings, provided by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in
          India, represent the energy efficiency of an air conditioner. The
          higher the star rating, the more energy-efficient the AC is. A 5-star
          AC consumes significantly less power than a 3-star AC while delivering
          the same level of cooling.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li>
            3-star AC: Moderate energy efficiency; ideal for infrequent use or
            smaller budgets.
          </li>
          <li>
            5-star AC: High energy efficiency; excellent for frequent use and
            long-term savings.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Understanding the Difference: 3-Star vs. 5-Star AC
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          One of the most common queries we receive is, “What’s the difference
          in power consumption between a 3-star and 5-star AC?” Let’s break it
          down:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER):</strong>
            <p className="ml-4">
              A 5-star AC has a higher EER compared to a 3-star AC, meaning it
              consumes less electricity to cool your room.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Electricity Consumption:</strong>
            <p className="ml-4">
              A 1.5-ton 3-star AC typically consumes about 0.6-0.8 units per
              hour, while a 1.5-ton 5-star AC consumes around 0.8-1.0 units per
              hour.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Cost Savings:</strong>
            <p className="ml-4">
              Assuming 8 hours of daily usage, the monthly savings with a 5-star
              AC can range between ₹500-₹800 compared to a 3-star AC, depending
              on your electricity rate.
            </p>
          </li>

          Why Inverter ACs Are a Game-Changer
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li>
            Inverter ACs adjust their compressor speed based on room
            temperature, consuming less power over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            A 3-star inverter AC can sometimes match or even outperform a 5-star
            non-inverter AC in energy efficiency.
          </li>
        </ul>
